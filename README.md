# spotify-popularity
This project uses machine learning to predict the popularity of songs on Spotify based on audio features and metadata. We applied multiple regression models and feature engineering techniques, with HistGradientBoosting achieving the best performance (RÂ² = 0.6817). SHAP values were used to interpret model behavior.
